## Background

Skills development and capacity building are key in achieving the SLASSCOM Vision 2022 of USD 5 billion in revenue, 200,000 jobs, and 1000 startups. This is essential for the economic growth of the country and is a significant opportunity to create more employment for the youth.

SLASSCOM interactions with the youth reveal that they are highly passionate to join the tech industry but lacks guidance on how-to. The National IT-BPM workforce survey 2019 conducted by the ICT Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA), reveals that the annual shortage of the IT-BPM workforce is 12,140. The local universities produce only 9,076 graduates a year and the annual demand stands at 21,216. This supply-demand gap is shown to keeps growing with the expansion of the industry. This widening demand-supply gap has become a major bottleneck that negatively impacts the growth of the IT-BPM sector.

## Purpose

The purpose of SLASSCOM creating this curriculum is to serve as a guidance to educational institutes in teaching the students at certificate and diploma levels. The content can be particularly important for vocational education. SLASSCOM with the support of the industry expects to keep this up-to-date continuously to reflect the latest skill demands in the IT Industry.

## Program Duration

The program will be offered over a period of 24 weeks with two intermediate evaluation points
happening after 6 weeks and 12 weeks respectively. The evaluations should be done by a panel consisting
of industry representatives and academics.
