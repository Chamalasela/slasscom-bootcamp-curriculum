## Underline Principles

This curriculum is built based on the following ground principles. If you wish to become a contributor it is important to understand and adhere to these principles.

<dl>
<dt>Applicability before theory</dt>
<dd>A common mistake of most curriculums is that they teach a lot of theory to students before they understand how and when to apply such. This curriculum is built for students to first experience and understand the usage so that they appreciate the theory when learnt later. For example students should use 'sorting' practically before learning to write a 'bubble sort' algorithm.</dd>
<dt>Hands-on lecturing</dt>
<dd>Rather than long presentation slides and descriptions, the lecturer should show/write 'real code' and explain the concepts to students.</dd>
<dt>Continuous evaluations</dt>
<dd>Student evaluation should be continuous and shouldn't happen at a final examination. Use interactive, gamified tools (such as Kahoot) to do fast and frequent evaluations. 
</dd>
<dt>Focused learning</dt>
<dd>If the curriculum is shallow and broad, students may learn many things, but wont master any. If you keep the curriculum narrow and deep, students will learn a limited things well, good enough to make a practical use of it. Since this curriculum is for 6 months and for entry levels, we propose focusing on few things and teach those well for a student to find a entry level job.

## Background

Skills development and capacity building are key in achieving the [SLASSCOM](https://slasscom.lk) Vision 2022 of USD 5 billion in revenue, 200,000 jobs, and 1000 startups.

The National IT-BPM workforce survey 2019 conducted by the ICT Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA), reveals that the annual shortage of the IT-BPM workforce is 12,140. The local universities produce only 9,076 graduates a year and the annual demand stands at 21,216. This supply-demand gap is shown to keeps growing with the expansion of the industry and has become a major bottleneck impacting the growth of the sector.
