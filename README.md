## Underline Principles

This curriculum is built based on the following ground principles. If you wish to become a contributor, it is essential to understand and adhere to these principles.

<dl>
<dt>Applicability before theory</dt>
<dd>A common mistake of most curriculums is that they teach a lot of theory to students before they understand how and when to apply such. This curriculum is built in a way students experience and understand the usage first so that they appreciate the theory when learned later. For example, students should use 'sorting' practically before learning to write a 'bubble sort' algorithm.</dd>
<dt>Hands-on lecturing</dt>
<dd>Rather than long presentation slides and descriptions, the lecturer should show/write 'real code' and explain the concepts to students.</dd>
<dt>Continuous evaluations</dt>
<dd>Student evaluation should be continuous and shouldn't happen at a final examination. Use interactive, gamified tools (such as Kahoot) to do fast and frequent evaluations. 
</dd>
<dt>Focused learning</dt>
<dd>If the curriculum is shallow and broad, students may learn many things but won't master any. If you keep the curriculum narrow and deep, students will learn a limited thing well enough to make practical use of it. Since this curriculum is for six months and entry levels, we propose focusing on a few things and teach those well for a student to find an entry-level job.

## Background

Skills development and capacity building are vital in achieving the [SLASSCOM](https://slasscom.lk) Vision 2022 of USD 5 billion in revenue, 200,000 jobs, and 1000 startups.

The National IT-BPM workforce survey 2019, conducted by the ICT Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA), reveals that the IT-BPM workforce's annual shortage is 12,140. The local universities produce only 9,076 graduates a year, and the annual demand stands at 21,216. This supply-demand gap is shown to keep growing with the industry's expansion and has become a significant bottleneck impacting the growth of the sector.
