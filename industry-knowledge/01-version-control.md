Git Patterns:

- Git Flows
- Trunk-based Development
- GitHub Flows
- Release Flows, and
- Conventional Commits

### Lab and tutorials

Make a tech talk video (~10 minutes) comparing below Git patterns with examples and publish onto YouTube. Use simple HTML code snippets to explain each concept.

Git patterns to compare:

- Git Flows using Azure DevOps, and
- GitHub Flows on GitHub

> **Tips:** 
>
> 1. No need of preparing a slide decks or presentation for the demo.
