### Lecture content

Discuss the techniques from: [coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github)

- Using Git Locally
- Working with Remotes, and
- Collaboration

### Lab and tutorials

First, learn and try to get familiar with common usage of Git commands as instructed in this simple guide:

[rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)

Next, learn briefly about following version control tools and create `hello-world` project using each of the tool.

- TFS project using Azure DevOps, and
- Git project using GitHub

Then, migrate the TFS project `hello-world` on Azure DevOps to your choice of Git repository, preferably GitHub.

### Lecture content

Discuss how billion dollar companies and popular OSS projects around the world use Git patterns in their day-to-day engineering activities.

Git Patterns:

- **Conventional Commits** introduced by Angular Team
- **GitHub Flows** in GitHub and many OSS projects, and
- **Release Flows** practices at Facebook Engineering and Microsoft

### Lab and tutorials

Make a tech talk video (~15 minutes) comparing below Git patterns with examples and publish onto YouTube. Use simple HTML code snippets to explain each of the Git patterns.

Git patterns to demonstrate:

- Conventional Commits
- GitFlow Workflows using Azure DevOps, and
- GitHub Flows on GitHub

> **Tips:** 
>
> 1. Slide decks and presentations for the demo and video are not expected.
> 2. Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, or similar software can be used for screen sharing that also supports recording.

## Assessment 1

> GitHub Pages: Create a **Hello, World** Blog

First, watch and try to get familiar with GitHub Pages to create your own Blog as instructed in this video tutorial:

[youtube.com/watch?v=RaKX4A5EiQo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaKX4A5EiQo)

Next, create a `public` Git repository named `https://github.com/<<your-username>>/hello-world`, if you have not, and enable GitHub Pages. Use either Jekyll or DocsifyJS ([docsify.js.org](https://docsify.js.org/#/?id=docsify)) for this assessment.

Blog posts to create:

- Create blog posts for each YouTube video you have created in previous assessments.
- Create blog posts for articles you have published in other media.

> **Tip**: Once the blog is published, it can be accessible using the link `https://<<your-username>>.github.io/hello-world`.
