### Self learning content

Students to search for the answers to the following questions online.

- What are the different programming paradigms available?
- What are the examples for each paradigm?
- Why Object orientation has gained popularity?
- OOP advantages and disadvantages.

Write a Blog post (150 words) on the topic 'Programming Paradigms'.

### Lecture content

Discuss why classes and objects are used in programming. Explain the difference between a functional language vs object oriented language. Prepare the students to learn OOP by providing basic understanding to appreciate the value of objects and classes.

Discuss OOP concepts:

- Objects
- Classes
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation

## Assessment 1

> Object Orientation

Study how a functional programming language such as JavaScript can be used to program in a Object Oriented manner. Create a GitHub repository with some sample code to demonstrate the concepts. Use GitHub README.md file to explain the concepts using code snippets.
