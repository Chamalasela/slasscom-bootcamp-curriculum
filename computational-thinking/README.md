# Module: Computational Thinking

## Aim

Introduce Computational thinking process for Problem Solving.

Computers are dumb machines. Before you can think about programming a computer, you need to work out exactly what it is you want the computer to do. Thinking through the problem and preparing it to be fed to a computer is Computational Thinking. Computational Thinking allows us to take complex problems, understand what the problem is, and develop solutions. We can present these solutions in a way that both computers and people can understand.

## Learning Outcomes

- Use number system representation to perform arithmetic operations.
- Apply knowledge of data structures and algorithms to implement a solution for a given problem.
- Apply Object Oriented Design principles to analyze real life problems and to design solutions
- Develop computer programs using the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm.
- Demonstrate the ability to use best coding practices.
