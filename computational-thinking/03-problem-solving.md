### Self learning content

Create a free Coursera account. Complete the week1 of the following free course before coming to class.

[https://www.coursera.org/learn/computational-thinking-problem-solving](https://www.coursera.org/learn/computational-thinking-problem-solving)

### Lecture content

Discuss the 4 pillars of computational thinking through examples.

- decomposition
- pattern recognition
- data representation and abstraction
- algorithms.

Talk about a software project (e.g. Library system) and explain how each of this is useful in designing the solution.

### Lab and tutorials
