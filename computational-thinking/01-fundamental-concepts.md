Get to know few of the programming concepts through playing a game

- sequence
- procedures (sub routes)
- iteration (loops)
- recursion

### Self learning content

Play LightBot and complete the _basic_ level which covers the topic of 'sequence'
https://lightbot.com/hour-of-code.html

### Lecture content

Discussion about programming concepts through [lightbot](https://lightbot.com/hour-of-code.html) game. Discuss how programs are made out of sequence of instructions. Discuss about procedures. Explain why loops and recursion are required.

### Lab and tutorials

Play LightBot and complete all levels of 'Procedures' and 'Loops'

### Assessment

None

Learn the following concepts through creating Scratch based games.

- selection
- iteration
- procedures/functions

### Self learning content

Learn Scratch by going through the official tutorials:
https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=getStarted

### Lecture content

Discuss the following principles and where and how they are being used in computer programs.

- Selection (If/else)
- Iteration (loops)
- Procedures (My blocks)

### Lab and tutorials

Create one new Games that uses all 3 principles selection, iteration and procedures.

### Assessment

Write a 200+ word Blog post regarding one of the following topics. In the blog post, include the reference to the Game created by the student at the Lab and Tutorials as an example code demonstrating the blog content.

- Computer Programs are essentially a sequence of instructions

- What is 'selection' in programing and why 'selection' is a most used concept in computer programs

- How 'Iteration' can make programs smaller and simpler

- How 'procedures' can make your program more readable
