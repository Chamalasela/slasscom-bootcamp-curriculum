Get to know few of the programming concepts through playing a game

- sequence
- procedures (sub routes)
- iteration (loops)
- recursion

### Self learning content

Play LightBot and complete the _basic_ level which covers the topic of 'sequence'
https://lightbot.com/hour-of-code.html

### Lecture content

Discussion about programming concepts through [lightbot](https://lightbot.com/hour-of-code.html) game. Discuss how programs are made out of sequence of instructions. Discuss about procedures. Explain why loops and recursion are required.

### Lab and tutorials

Play LightBot and complete all levels of 'Procedures' and 'Loops'

### Assessment

None

Learn the following concepts through creating Scratch based games.

- selection
- iteration
- procedures/functions

### Self learning content

Learn Scratch by going through the official tutorials:
https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=getStarted

### Lecture content

Discuss the following principles and where and how they are being used in computer programs.

- Selection (If/else)
- Iteration (loops)
- Procedures (My blocks)

### Lab and tutorials

Create one new Games that uses all 3 principles selection, iteration and procedures.

Write a 200+ word Blog post regarding one of the following topics. In the blog post, include the reference to the Game created by the student at the Lab and Tutorials as an example code demonstrating the blog content.

- Computer Programs are essentially a sequence of instructions
- What is 'selection' in programing and why 'selection' is a most used concept in computer programs
- How 'Iteration' can make programs smaller and simpler
- How 'procedures' can make your program more readable

### Lecture content

Discuss what variables are and the usage of those in programming.
Discuss how variables are related to computer memory.
Briefly discuss different data types.
Discuss how few programming languages declare variables with different syntaxes.

### Lab and tutorials

Make one or more games with Scratch using variables to demonstrate 3 different usages of variables and lists

1. To store information
2. To manipulate data
3. To pass information around

Write a 200+ word blog post on what variables are and how they are useful in programming

### Lecture content

Discuss events and how they are important in real world programs.
For example capturing user events on user interfaces and broadcasting messages for listeners to decouple code modules.

### Lab and tutorials

Make one more Scratch game using events to demonstrate all of the following

1. Click events
2. Key press events
3. Message broadcast
